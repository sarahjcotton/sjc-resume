			<h1>Sarah Cotton</h1>
			<h3 class="sub">Full Stack Web Engineer</h3>
			<p>A highly driven, self motivated, confident and adaptable individual with a passion for continuous improvement and problem solving. My primary focus has been developing bespoke customisations and integrations for the open source platform Moodle but would like to branch out into a more creative field of work and learn new skills. With excellent interpersonal communication, I have experience managing a small team and building close working relationships with colleagues both inter and intradepartmental and have presented at several Moodle conferences.</p>
			<p>Attention to detail and accuracy in all aspects of my work is a matter of pride, and I give 100% to all that I do.</p>
